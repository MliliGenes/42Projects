# C++ Module 00: Encapsulation, Orthodoxy, and Arrays

This module introduces fundamental concepts of C++ programming, focusing on encapsulation, orthodox canonical form, and working with arrays of objects.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

A simple program that takes command-line arguments and prints them in uppercase. If no arguments are provided, it prints a default message. This exercise demonstrates basic input/output and string manipulation.

**Files:**
- `ex00/megaphone.cpp`
- `ex00/Makefile`

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

A command-line phonebook application that allows users to add and search for contacts. This exercise introduces the concept of classes and objects, with a `Contact` class to store contact information and a `PhoneBook` class to manage the contacts.

**Files:**
- `ex01/Contact.hpp`, `ex01/Contact.cpp`
- `ex01/PhoneBook.hpp`, `ex01/PhoneBook.cpp`
- `ex01/main.cpp`
- `ex01/Makefile`

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

A program that simulates bank account operations. The `Account` class tracks deposits, withdrawals, and the total amount. This exercise focuses on class implementation and the use of static members to manage data shared across all instances of a class.

**Files:**
- `ex02/Account.hpp`, `ex02/Account.cpp`
- `ex02/tests.cpp`
- `ex02/Makefile`
