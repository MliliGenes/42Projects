# Push_swap

`push_swap` is a project from 42 school that challenges us to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to find the most efficient sequence of operations to sort the stack.

## The Stacks

The project uses two stacks, `a` and `b`. Initially, stack `a` contains the random list of integers, and stack `b` is empty. The goal is to sort the integers in stack `a` in ascending order.

## The Operations

The following operations are allowed:

- `sa`: Swap the first two elements of stack `a`.
- `sb`: Swap the first two elements of stack `b`.
- `ss`: `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa`: Push the first element of stack `b` to the top of stack `a`.
- `pb`: Push the first element of stack `a` to the top of stack `b`.
- `ra`: Rotate stack `a` (the first element becomes the last).
- `rb`: Rotate stack `b`.
- `rr`: `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra`: Reverse rotate stack `a` (the last element becomes the first).
- `rrb`: Reverse rotate stack `b`.
- `rrr`: `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

## The `checker` Program

The `checker` program is used to verify that the sequence of operations generated by `push_swap` correctly sorts the stack. It takes the same list of integers as `push_swap` and reads the operations from standard input.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the project:** Run `make` to compile both `push_swap` and `checker`.
2. **Run `push_swap`:** Execute the `push_swap` binary with a list of integers as arguments. It will output the sequence of operations to sort the stack.
3. **Run `checker`:** Pipe the output of `push_swap` to `checker` to verify the result.

### Example

```bash
$> ARG=`ruby -e "puts (1..5).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK
```
